=== FAQ ===
Q: How do I integrate with external services or APIs?
1) First of all, make sure you have an API that receives GET/POST parameters and responds in JSON format. 
2) Secondly, go to "Slots and Actions" page to configure your input/output slots (parameters), and actions.  
- Input slots are the variables sent to your API. Its values are collected during the conversation. 
- Output slots are variables collected from your API response. Its values are used to generate an answer. 
- Each action requires input/output slots that it's going to use, as well as the API parameters (Endpoint URL, Header, etc)
3) Then go to "Dialogue Scenarios" page to give examples of how the action that you just configured should be called.

A: We activate new accounts manually, so it may take up to 12 hours. You will get your credentials soon

Q: The generated bot will be the same as chatGPT and Chatsonic? In that case, do I need an OpenAI API? Or is just a service chatbot that can aswer just product related questions like any other chatbot from any website?
A: You don't need the OpenAI API key to use our platform. The platform already has one. Yes, it is mainly built to help companies automate their customer support by answering product-related questions and performing actions (retrieving information from API, etc). The difference from other platforms is that it understands the context and is fast to get started. But since it's GPT4-based,  you may expect it to show expert knowledge in many areas as ChatGPT does. I suggest trying it for free by giving instructions on how it should act and providing sample dialogue.

Q: How do I connect human agents?
A: There's a built-in action called "connect-human-agent" that transfers the user to a human agent. The "Lead Qualifier" template has this capability. Detailed instructions are available at https://s1.webapi.ai/article/91

# About the Lite version
The Lite version is the easiest to start with, yet very powerful.
It supports Domain Knowledge (Instructions, Knowledge base, FAQ) and Forms.
Forms is probably the most exciting part of the Lite version. You declare the user information that needs to be collected, like email, address, and phone number. Then add "show form [form name]" as an instruction to the Domain Knowledge. That's it, now the chatbot will start asking for the required user information based on your instruction. Once collected, it will be added into our built-in Spreadsheets, emailed to your email address, and sent via integrations (API/Pabbly/Zapier)
