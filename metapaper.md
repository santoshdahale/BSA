Training your own small language model (SLM) using the metacognitive reasoning technique from the Meta AI paper "Metacognitive Reuse: Turning Recurring LLM Reasoning Into Concise Behaviors" (referenced in the X thread by Connor Davis, https://x.com/connordavis_ai/status/1971937800980517124) is an exciting challenge! Given your purpose—SQL generation, intent identification, and function calling to Python financial libraries—I’ll guide you step-by-step on how to adapt this method. This will be tailored to the current date (08:43 AM IST, Sunday, September 28, 2025) and the latest AI practices, leveraging my continuously updated knowledge.

### Overview of the Method
The paper introduces a technique where an LLM/SLM reflects on its reasoning traces to extract reusable "behaviors" (e.g., "behavior_inclusion_exclusion"), which are then used to fine-tune the model or condition it at runtime. This reduces token usage (46% on MATH problems) and boosts reasoning accuracy (10% on AIME). For your use case, you’ll adapt this to extract behaviors relevant to SQL query construction, intent parsing, and financial function calls.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Train Your SLM

#### 1. Choose a Base Model
Since you’re targeting an SLM (small language model, typically <7B parameters for efficiency), consider these options based on 2025 standards:
- **Base Model Recommendations**:
  - **Meta’s Code Llama 7B** (or 3B if memory-constrained): Optimized for code generation, including SQL, and lightweight. The AWS blog (2025-04-24) highlights its 1–3 second SQL generation latency, making it suitable for your needs.
  - **Mistral 7B**: A highly efficient open-source SLM with strong language understanding, adaptable for intent identification and function calling with fine-tuning.
  - **Grok 3 (xAI, if accessible)**: As a curious AI, I’d suggest exploring if xAI releases a smaller variant by 2025, given its focus on reasoning—potentially alignable with metacognitive techniques.
- **Why These?**: These models are pre-trained on diverse corpora, including code, and are small enough to fine-tune on consumer hardware (e.g., 16GB GPU) while supporting your multi-task goals. Code Llama is particularly relevant for SQL and Python integration.
- **Considerations**: Start with 7B for balance; scale down to 3B if memory or compute is limited, though this may reduce performance.

#### 2. Prepare Your Dataset
Your model needs training data for SQL generation, intent identification, and financial library function calling. Create a dataset with:
- **SQL Generation**:
  - Pairs of natural language queries (e.g., "Show me the total sales by region") and corresponding SQL (e.g., `SELECT region, SUM(sales) FROM sales_table GROUP BY region;`).
  - Use financial datasets (e.g., Kaggle’s financial datasets or synthetic data from pandas DataFrames).
- **Intent Identification**:
  - Annotated examples like: Input: "Calculate the ROI for this stock," Intent: "financial_calculation," Function: `roi_calculation(stock_data)`.
  - Include intents like "sql_query," "function_call," and "clarify_input."
- **Function Calling to Python Financial Libraries**:
  - Map intents to Python functions from libraries like `pandas` (e.g., `df.groupby()`), `numpy` (e.g., `np.mean()`), or `yfinance` (e.g., `yfinance.download()`).
  - Example: Input: "Get the 30-day moving average for AAPL," Output: `yfinance.download("AAPL", period="30d")["Close"].rolling(30).mean()`.
- **Format**: Use JSONL with fields like `{"input": "...", "sql": "...", "intent": "...", "function_call": "..."}`.
- **Size**: Aim for 10K–50K examples, mixing synthetic (generated via GPT-4o or Grok) and real data.

#### 3. Implement the Metacognitive Behavior Curation Pipeline
Adapt the paper’s method to your tasks:
- **Step 1: Initial Reasoning Traces**:
  - Fine-tune the base model on your dataset using a framework like Hugging Face Transformers. Use a supervised learning objective (e.g., cross-entropy loss) to generate SQL, intents, and function calls.
  - Example command:
    ```bash
    accelerate launch --num_processes 1 train.py \
      --model_name "meta-llama/CodeLlama-7b-hf" \
      --dataset_path "financial_tasks.jsonl" \
      --output_dir "trained_model"
    ```
  - Collect reasoning traces by prompting the model with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts (e.g., "Think step-by-step to generate SQL for this query...").

- **Step 2: Behavior Extraction**:
  - Analyze traces to identify recurring patterns. For example:
    - SQL: "JOIN tables based on ID" becomes "behavior_table_join".
    - Intent: "Parse financial term" becomes "behavior_intent_financial".
    - Function: "Apply rolling mean" becomes "behavior_rolling_mean".
  - Use a script to cluster similar trace segments (e.g., with cosine similarity on embeddings from a sentence transformer) and distill them into concise behaviors.
  - Example Python snippet:
    ```python
    from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
    import numpy as np

    model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
    traces = ["JOIN table1 ON id...", "JOIN table2 ON id..."]  # Extracted traces
    embeddings = model.encode(traces)
    similarities = np.dot(embeddings, embeddings.T)
    # Cluster similar traces to form behaviors
    ```

- **Step 3: Create the Behavior Handbook**:
  - Store behaviors in a JSON file or in-memory dict, e.g.:
    ```json
    {
      "behavior_table_join": "JOIN {table1} ON {id} = {table2}.{id}",
      "behavior_intent_financial": "Identify financial terms: [stock, ROI, mean]",
      "behavior_rolling_mean": "Apply pd.Series.rolling({window}).mean()"
    }
    ```
  - Save to disk for persistence (as discussed earlier).

- **Step 4: Fine-Tune with Behavior-Conditioned Traces**:
  - Augment your dataset with behavior-conditioned prompts. For example:
    - Original: "Show total sales by region" → SQL.
    - Conditioned: "Use behavior_table_join to show total sales by region" → SQL.
  - Fine-tune the model again, using the conditioned data to embed these behaviors into its reasoning process.

#### 4. Train the Model
- **Hardware**: A 16GB GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 3090) or Google Colab Pro+ should suffice for 7B models with mixed precision (FP16).
- **Framework**: Use Hugging Face’s `transformers` with `peft` for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA).
- **Hyperparameters**:
  - Learning rate: 2e-5
  - Batch size: 4 (adjust based on memory)
  - Epochs: 3–5
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=1 train.py \
    --model_name "trained_model" \
    --dataset_path "behavior_conditioned.jsonl" \
    --lora_r 8 \
    --lora_alpha 16 \
    --output_dir "final_model"
  ```

#### 5. Deploy with Runtime Behavior Conditioning
- **Inference Setup**: Load the model and Behavior Handbook. Use a custom inference wrapper to condition outputs.
- **Example Code**:
  ```python
  from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
  import json

  model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("final_model")
  tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("final_model")
  with open("behavior_handbook.json", "r") as f:
      behaviors = json.load(f)

  def generate_response(input_text):
      behavior = select_behavior(input_text, behaviors)  # Custom logic
      prompt = f"Use {behavior} to process: {input_text}"
      inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
      outputs = model.generate(**inputs)
      return tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

  print(generate_response("Calculate 30-day moving average for AAPL"))
  ```
- **Behavior Selection**: Implement a simple rule-based or ML classifier to match inputs to behaviors (e.g., keyword matching or intent detection).

#### 6. Evaluate and Iterate
- **Metrics**:
  - SQL: Exact match or BLEU score against ground truth.
  - Intent: Accuracy of intent classification.
  - Function Calling: Success rate of executing Python calls (e.g., via `eval()` with safety checks).
- **Test Set**: Use 10% of your dataset as a holdout.
- **Iterate**: Refine behaviors based on errors (e.g., add "behavior_error_handling" if SQL fails).

### Using the Paper
- **Read Sections 3–5**: Focus on the behavior extraction pipeline (Section 3), SFT experiments (Section 5.3), and evaluation (Section 5). These detail the metacognitive process and fine-tuning.
- **Adapt Experiments**: Replicate the MATH/AIME setup but with your tasks. Use the paper’s 46% token reduction as a benchmark for efficiency.
- **Code Reference**: The paper likely includes pseudocode or a GitHub link (check https://arxiv.org/abs/xxxx.xxxxx); adapt it for SQL/intent/function tasks.

### Purpose-Specific Considerations
- **SQL Generation**: Leverage Code Llama’s code expertise and behaviors like "behavior_table_join" to handle complex joins or aggregations.
- **Intent Identification**: Use behaviors to tag financial terms (e.g., "behavior_intent_financial") and train a multi-label classifier if needed.
- **Function Calling**: Map behaviors to library functions (e.g., "behavior_rolling_mean" → `pandas.rolling.mean`) and validate outputs against financial data.

### Challenges and Tips
- **Compute**: If resources are tight, use quantized models (4-bit) via `bitsandbytes`.
- **Safety**: For function calling, sandbox `eval()` with `restrictedpython` to prevent malicious code execution.
- **Scalability**: Start small (3B model, 10K samples) and scale up as needed.

### Conclusion
Start with Code Llama 7B, build a dataset for your tasks, extract behaviors using trace analysis, fine-tune with conditioned data, and deploy with a runtime handbook. The paper’s method is adaptable—focus on curating task-specific behaviors to enhance your SLM’s efficiency and accuracy. By 08:43 AM IST on September 28, 2025, you could have a prototype running with this approach!
